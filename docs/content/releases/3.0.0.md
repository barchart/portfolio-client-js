**Breaking Changes**

* Changed mechanism for passing JSON Web Tokens to the ```PortfolioGateway```. Consumers are now required to provide ```JwtProvider``` instances instead of a ```RequestInterceptor``` instances. Here are the specifics:
  * The ```RequestInterceptor``` argument was replaced with a ```JwtProvider``` argument on static factory functions (e.g. ```PortfolioGateway.forProduction```).
  * The ```RequestInterceptor``` argument was removed from the ```PortfolioGateway``` constructor.
  * The ```PortfolioGateway.start``` function was renamed to ```PortfolioGateway.connect``` and now has a ```JwtProvider``` argument.
  * The ```JwtGateway``` and ```JwtEndpoint``` classes were removed.
  * Static factory functions for impersonating users in the ```test``` and ```development``` environments were added. See ```JwtProvider.forTest``` and ```JwtProvider.forDevelopment```.
* Removed ```PortfolioGateway.batchTransactions``` function.
